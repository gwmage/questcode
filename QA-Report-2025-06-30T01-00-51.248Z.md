# QA Report for eposo.ai 기능 점검

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent successfully logged in and navigated to the timeline, but encountered issues when trying to interact with the milestone creation feature. Unable to proceed further due to these issues.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 2: Navigate to Timeline
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 3: Interact with Milestone Functionality (Add and Input Content)
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was unable to successfully add content to a milestone. Attempts to edit existing milestone names were successful. However, attempts to input into the milestone content section directly or using AI generation timed out or failed to register. This indicates potential issues with the content editor component or its integration. A potential nav element intercepting the click action was also noted, requiring clicking the milestone name instead of the edit button, but this did not solve the underlying issue.
