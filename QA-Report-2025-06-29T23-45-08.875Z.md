# QA Report for eposo.ai Website Testing

## Summary

**Test Failed.** The agent successfully logged in and navigated to the timeline and settings pages, but failed to interact with key elements on these pages. Specifically, adding milestones and stories to the timeline, and adding a user with admin privileges to a project in settings, were unsuccessful due to the UI elements being unresponsive or generating errors. The test was terminated before attempting to log out.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 2: Navigate to Timeline
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 3: Verify and Interact with Timeline (Milestone and Story)
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The "마일스톤 추가" and "스토리 추가" buttons on the timeline page were unresponsive. Attempting to generate an AI schedule also failed. The underlying cause is unknown, but the UI elements appear to be dysfunctional. This could be related to JavaScript errors preventing event listeners from being properly bound, or server-side issues.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the '마일스톤 추가' button.
  2. Click the '스토리 추가' button.
  3. Click the '수정 파일 업로드로 AI 일정 생성하기' button.
- **Final Error Log:** None. No explicit errors were generated, but the actions did not result in any observable change to the UI, indicating a lack of response from the clicked elements.

### Objective 4: Add User with Admin Privileges in Settings
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was able to navigate to the settings page, but adding a user with '관리자' privileges to the "소개팅앱X" project failed. The "수정" button for the "소개팅앱X" project appears to be unresponsive. When trying to add a user by email, an error occurred because the identified element was not an input field. This suggests the selector is incorrect or the element is not behaving as expected.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the '소개팅앱X' 프로젝트의 '수정' 버튼.
  2. Fill 담당자 이메일 입력 필드에 'gwmage@rcanelab.com'을 입력합니다.
  3. '관리자' 권한 버튼을 클릭합니다.
- **Final Error Log:**
\`\`\`
page.fill: Error: Element is not an input, textarea, select or contenteditable and does not have a role allowing ariareadonly
Call log:
  2m   waiting for locator(dataaiid172)22m

  2m   attempting fill action22m
  2m     waiting for element to be visible, enabled and editable22m
\`\`\`
This error message indicates that the `locator` used to identify the email input field (`data-ai-id="172"`) is pointing to a `div` element, not an `input`, `textarea`, or `select` element as required by the `fill` action. Also it has an attribute "aria-readonly", so the AI agent cant fill this form

### Objective 5: Logout
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped due to failure in previous objectives. The agent could not reliably interact with the website.
