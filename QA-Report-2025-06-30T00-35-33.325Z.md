# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Incomplete.** The agent was unable to progress beyond the initial login screen due to JavaScript errors preventing the application from functioning correctly. Therefore, only the login objective could be assessed.

## Details

### Objective 1: Eposo.ai에 로그인합니다.
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent encountered an issue right from the beginning. The web application was not functioning as expected due to the absence of JavaScript execution. The agent identified a container element stating that "EPOSO doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled." This means the subsequent steps relying on JavaScript functionality, including navigating to the timeline and interacting with milestones and stories, were impossible to execute.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the 'Login/Sign Up' button.
- **Final Error Log:** The initial page load already displayed a message indicating that JavaScript was not enabled, preventing proper functioning of the website. No specific error logs related to login were generated, as the site's core functionality was compromised from the start. The agent could only identify the "Login/Sign Up" button which was clicked, but the site did not respond correctly. The relevant HTML element displayed the message: `<strong>We're sorry but EPOSO doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled. Please enable it to continue.</strong>`
