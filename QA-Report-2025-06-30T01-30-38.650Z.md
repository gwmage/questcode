# QA Report for eposo.ai Feature Check

## Summary
**Test Partially Passed.** The agent successfully logged in and navigated to the timeline page. However, it failed to interact with elements on the timeline page due to an inability to get the page structure information from modal dialogs.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in to Eposo.ai
- **Status:** Success
- **Reason:** The agent successfully navigated to the login page, entered the provided email and password, and clicked the login button.

### Objective 2: Navigate to the Timeline
- **Status:** Success
- **Reason:** After successful login, the agent successfully identified and clicked the "Timeline" link in the navigation menu.

### Objective 3: Verify and Input content into Milestone and Story features
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** While the agent successfully navigated to the timeline page, it failed to interact with either the Milestone or Story functionalities. The agent attempted to click the "마일스톤 추가" button, but the next action failed because the new page context wasn't received, therefore the action was not performed. It then attempted to click the "스토리 추가" button with a similar result. This indicates a potential issue with how the application handles modal dialogs and how the testing framework interacts with them. More specifically, the agent did not receive the page information with the modal dialog.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the '수정 파일 업로드로 AI 일정 생성하기' button (마일스톤 추가).
  2. Click the '스토리 추가' button.
- **Final Error Log:**
```
No error log available.
```
No error log available, because the agent's process was terminated due to it not knowing what to do next. It was waiting for the page context (the modal's structure information), which it never received.

### Objective 4: Assign a person in Story
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped because the "Verify and Input content into Milestone and Story features" step failed.

### Objective 5: Add gwmage@rcanelab.com as "고객" to "소개팅앱X" project in Settings
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped because the "Verify and Input content into Milestone and Story features" step failed, so the agent could not proceed to the "Settings" page.

### Objective 6: Log out
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped because the "Verify and Input content into Milestone and Story features" step failed, so the agent could not proceed to the logout step.
