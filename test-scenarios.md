Okay, here are 10 diverse and practical test scenarios for eposo.ai, designed for an autonomous QA agent:

1.  Attempt to create a user with an invalid email format and verify that the system displays an appropriate error message.
2.  Drag and drop a task from one sprint to another on the timeline view and confirm the task's sprint assignment is updated.
3.  Invite a new team member to a project with 'Viewer' permissions and verify that their access is restricted to read-only.
4.  Trigger a notification (e.g., by assigning a task) and confirm its appearance in the notification center, along with accurate details.
5.  Change the language setting from English to Spanish and verify that the user interface elements are properly translated.
6.  Upload a file larger than the maximum allowed size to a task and verify that an error message is displayed and the upload fails.
7.  Search for a task by its name within a project and verify that the correct task is returned as the top search result.
8.  Update the status of a task to "Completed" and confirm the completion date is automatically populated and saved.
9.  Export the project data as a CSV file and verify that the file is generated, downloaded, and contains the expected data fields.
10. Attempt to delete a project that has active tasks and verify that the system prevents deletion and prompts to resolve the active tasks first.
