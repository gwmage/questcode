# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent failed to log in to the eposo.ai website due to a JavaScript error preventing the login page from loading correctly.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was unable to navigate to the login page after clicking the "Login/Sign Up" button or the "Sign up and try our service" link. The page context remained unchanged, indicating a failure in navigation or a JavaScript error preventing the page from loading correctly. The initial page also displays a message indicating that JavaScript is not enabled, which is likely the root cause of the issue.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the 'Login/Sign Up' button.
  2. Click the 'Sign up and try our service' link.
- **Final Error Log:** The page context did not change after clicking the buttons, and the following message was present on the page: "We're sorry but EPOSO doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled. Please enable it to continue." This indicates that JavaScript is either not enabled or not running correctly, preventing the website from functioning as expected. The agent is unable to proceed without JavaScript functionality.
