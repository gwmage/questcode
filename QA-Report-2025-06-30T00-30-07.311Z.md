# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent was unable to interact with the webpage because the page structure could not be determined. This prevented the agent from logging in and performing any subsequent actions.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent could not log in because the page's element tree could not be constructed. This means the agent was unable to identify any of the interactive elements on the page, including the email and password fields, or the login button.
- **Attempted Actions:** None, as the agent could not identify any elements to interact with.
- **Final Error Log:**
\`\`\`
Could not build the page element tree.
