# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Partially Passed.** The agent successfully logged in and added a user to the project settings, but failed to interact with the timeline elements.  The logout attempt also failed due to a timeout. This indicates potential issues with the timeline's UI element interaction and the logout functionality.

## Details

### Objective 1: Login to Eposo.ai
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 2: Navigate to the Timeline
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 3: Verify Milestone and Story Functionality and Input Data
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:**  The agent was unable to interact with the input fields for both milestones and stories. The error logs suggest the identified input elements were not editable, possibly due to them being read-only or having an overlaying element preventing interaction. This needs investigation from the development team.
- **Attempted Actions:**
    1.  Entering text into a milestone input field.
    2.  Entering text into a story input field.
- **Final Error Log (Milestone):**
```
page.fill: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
Call log:
2m   waiting for locator(inputtypetext)22m
2m     locator resolved to 10 elements. Proceeding with the first one: input readonly typetext tabindex0 placeholder teleportfalse autopositionfalse classcustomdatepicker22m
2m     fill(Test Milestone)22m
... (truncated for brevity - similar repeated attempts)
```
The key issue highlighted here is `element is not editable`.  The locator seems to be finding elements related to a date picker (`classcustomdatepicker`), which might not be the intended target for direct text input.

- **Final Error Log (Story):**
```
page.fill: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
Call log:
2m   waiting for locator(inputtypetext)22m
2m     locator resolved to 10 elements. Proceeding with the first one: input readonly typetext tabindex0 placeholder teleportfalse autopositionfalse classcustomdatepicker22m
2m     fill(Test Story Text)22m
... (truncated for brevity - similar repeated attempts)
```
The error is identical to the milestone input, suggesting a similar root cause - likely an incorrect locator targeting a read-only date picker element instead of the intended story input field.


### Objective 4: Assign a User to a Story
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** This step was skipped due to the failure of the previous objective. Inputting text into the story field is a prerequisite to assigning a user.

### Objective 5: Add User 'gwmage@rcanelab.com' as Administrator to Project '소개팅앱X' in Settings
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 6: Logout
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The logout action timed out. The provided error log is insufficient to pinpoint the exact cause. It only indicates that the locator was waiting for an element (likely the logout button) that never appeared or became interactable within the timeout period. Further debugging is required.
- **Attempted Actions:**
    1. Click the logout button.
- **Final Error Log:**
```
page.click: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.
Call log:
2m   waiting for locator(text)22m
```
The vague `waiting for locator(text)` suggests a problem with the logout button locator. It's missing the actual text it was searching for.  This needs to be corrected for accurate targeting and debugging. This timeout indicates the logout button element was either not found, not visible, or not interactable within 10 seconds.
