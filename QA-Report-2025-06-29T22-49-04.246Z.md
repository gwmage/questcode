# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent was unable to log in to the website because after entering the email address, the website failed to prompt for a password.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** After entering the email address in the email field and pressing 'Enter', the website did not display the password input field. This prevented the agent from completing the login process. It appears there's an issue with the website's authentication flow, specifically the transition from email input to password input.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the login button to open the login form
  2. Click the email login button
  3. Fill the email input field
  4. Press Enter to submit the email and reveal the password field.
- **Final Error Log:**
  The final state shows that after pressing 'Enter' on the email field, the interactive elements on the page remained the same, indicating that the password field was not loaded, and the page did not transition to the next step in the login process. There's no explicit error log from the agent, but the lack of progress and the unchanged page state strongly suggest a failure in the website's handling of the email submission.
