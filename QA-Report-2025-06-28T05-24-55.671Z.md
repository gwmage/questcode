# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent was unable to log in to eposo.ai using the provided email and password.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent attempted to log in using the 'Email Login' option, filling in the email and password fields. However, the login form did not submit successfully, and the page remained on the login screen. Pressing Enter and clicking the Email Login button again did not resolve the issue. The agent also attempted to fill the email and password with force: true, but the login form still did not submit successfully. There is either an issue with the credentials provided or an issue with the login functionality on the website.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the 'Login/Sign Up' button to open the login form.
  2. Click the 'Email Login' button.
  3. Fill in the email field with the provided email address.
  4. Fill in the password field with the provided password.
  5. Press 'Enter' key in the password field to submit the login form.
  6. Click the 'Email Login' button again.
  7. Refill the email field with the provided email address with force:true
  8. Refill the password field with the provided password with force:true
  9. Press 'Enter' key in the password field to submit the login form with force:true

The error message `Unexpected token while parsing css selector input typepassword classcform__input error.... Did you mean to CSS.escape it` indicates that there is an issue with how the CSS selector is being parsed when attempting to press the Enter key. This suggests that the selector used might be invalid or contains characters that need to be escaped for proper CSS parsing. The error occurs when trying to locate the password input field using the provided CSS selector.
