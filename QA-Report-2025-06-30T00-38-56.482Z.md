# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent was unable to sign up for the service due to a JavaScript error on the landing page, preventing navigation to the sign-up form. This is a critical blocker.

## Details

### Objective 1: Sign up for the service
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was unable to navigate to the sign-up page after clicking the 'Sign up and try our service' link. The website indicated a JavaScript error prevented proper functioning. The root cause is likely missing or malfunctioning JavaScript code, which is a critical functional problem.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the 'Login/Sign Up' button.
  2. Click the 'Sign up and try our service' link.
- **Final Error Log:**
  \`\`\`
  null
  \`\`\`
  While no specific error was logged by the agent, the page context indicated: "We're sorry but EPOSO doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled. Please enable it to continue." This strongly indicates a JavaScript error is preventing the application from functioning as expected.
