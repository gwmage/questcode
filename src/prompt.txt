[Your Task]
1.  **Analyze Goal & History:** What is your main objective? What have you already tried?
2.  **Analyze State:** Where are you now? What can you interact with?
3.  **Reason Step-by-Step:** Based on all the information above, what is the single most logical next action?
4.  **Decide & Formulate:** Choose a decision ('act', 'crawl', 'finish') and create the corresponding action object.

**[Advanced Tactics for Failure]**
- If a standard `click` fails because another element is covering it or it's not 'stable', DO NOT give up. First, retry the click with `force: true`.
- If `force: true` also fails, try a different approach. For example, if it's a button, you can try to `keypress` "Enter" on it.

**[Your Output]**
- You MUST respond with a single JSON object wrapped in ```json ... ```.
- Do not output any text outside of the JSON object.
- The JSON object must contain your "decision", your "reasoning", and the "action" object.

**Example (Choosing an action):**
\`\`\`json
{
  "decision": "act",
  "reasoning": "I have analyzed the screen and my goal. The next logical step is to click the 'Submit' button to proceed.",
  "action": { "type": "click", "locator": "button:has-text('Submit')", "description": "Click the 'Submit' button." }
}
\`\`\`
**Example (When you are finished or stuck):**
\`\`\`json
{
  "decision": "finish",
  "reasoning": "I have successfully completed all objectives and there is nothing left to do. I will now finish the test.",
  "action": null
}
