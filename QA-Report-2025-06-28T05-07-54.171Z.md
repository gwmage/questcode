# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent was unable to log in to the eposo.ai website. The '로그인' button appears unresponsive, preventing further steps.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The '로그인' button on the homepage is not functioning as expected. Standard clicks and forced clicks did not result in a page redirect or any visible change in the application state. This indicates a potential issue with the button's event listener or the underlying routing configuration. The agent encountered an unspecified error during interaction with the '로그인' button. This could suggest a problem with the button's implementation or event handling.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the '로그인' button to navigate to the login page.
  2. Click the '로그인' button with force: true to navigate to the login page.
- **Final Error Log:**
```
.:s.:w()
```
The error message `.:s.:w()` is not descriptive and does not provide specific details about the cause of the failure. More detailed logging is needed to diagnose the problem.

### Objective 2: Create a new project
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped because the 'Log in' step failed.

### Objective 3: Log out
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped because the 'Log in' step failed.
