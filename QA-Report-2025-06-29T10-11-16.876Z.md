# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent successfully logged in but failed to interact with the Timeline and project settings as instructed due to numerous timeouts and issues with element selection. The agent encountered difficulties navigating to the Timeline page and was unable to enter text into milestone input fields, likely due to incorrect element selection or the elements being in an uneditable state.  Adding a user to the project was also unsuccessful due to repeated failures in locating and interacting with the "소개팅앱X수정삭제" button which is presumed to lead to the project settings.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in to eposo.ai
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 2: Navigate to the Timeline page
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:**  The agent repeatedly failed to navigate to the Timeline page, encountering timeout errors. The agent appears to be struggling to locate the correct element for navigation. The forced actions taken suggest the agent was stuck in a loop and unable to find the intended link.
- **Attempted Actions:**
    1. Click the 'Timeline' link (repeated 3 times).
    2. Forced Clicks: 'Navigate to slide 1', 'Navigate to slide 3', '에픽' (These actions were taken to break out of the navigation loop).
- **Final Error Log:**
```
page.click: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.
Call log:
2m   waiting for locator(a:hastext())22m
```
This error indicates that the agent could not find the element with the expected text within the 10-second timeout.  The `locator(a:hastext())` suggests a problem with the locator used to identify the Timeline link. It's unclear what text the locator was searching for.

### Objective 3: Interact with Milestones and Stories on the Timeline
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent encountered timeout errors when attempting to enter text into milestone input fields. The log suggests that the locator found 10 matching elements and proceeded with the first one, which happened to be a readonly input field of a datepicker, explaining why the agent couldn't enter text. This indicates an issue with the locator's specificity – it's not targeting the correct input field.
- **Attempted Actions:**
    1. Entering text into a milestone input field (repeated multiple times with variations of input text).
    2. Forced Clicks: 'TTest', '수정 파일 업로드로 AI 일정 생성하기' (Likely attempts to refresh the view or force a different state to interact with the elements.)
- **Final Error Log:**
```
page.fill: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
Call log:
2m   waiting for locator(inputtypetext)22m
2m     locator resolved to 10 elements. Proceeding with the first one: input readonly typetext tabindex0 placeholder teleportfalse autopositionfalse classcustomdatepicker22m
2m     fill(Test Milestone Entry)22m
2m   attempting fill action22m
2m    2  waiting for element to be visible, enabled and editable22m
2m       element is not editable22m
...
```
This log clearly indicates the element found is a read-only datepicker, thus preventing text input.

### Objective 4: Assign a user to a Story (on the Timeline)
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** This step was skipped because the agent was unable to interact with the Timeline successfully (Objective 3).

### Objective 5: Add user gwmage@rcanelab.com as '관리자' to the '소개팅앱X' project in Settings
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent repeatedly failed to locate and interact with the "소개팅앱X수정삭제" button which is assumed to be the entry point for project settings. The repeated attempts and forced clicks suggest an issue with the element locator or the element's visibility/interactability on the page.
- **Attempted Actions:**
    1. Clicking "소개팅앱X수정삭제" (repeated numerous times).
    2. Numerous forced clicks on various other elements in an apparent attempt to navigate to the relevant section.
- **Final Error Log:**  While there isn't a specific final error log for this interaction, the repetitive clicking of "소개팅앱X수정삭제" and the subsequent forced clicks strongly indicate a failure to interact with this element, effectively blocking the intended action.  The lack of a timeout error may suggest that the element is technically present in the DOM, but not interactable or visible in the way the agent expects.

### Objective 6: Log out and finish the test
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped due to the prior failures.


This QA report highlights significant issues with the eposo.ai web application, specifically regarding navigation, element interaction, and potentially the UI itself.  The developers should investigate the locators used by the agent, the state of the elements (especially the readonly datepicker and the project settings button), and potential UI/UX issues that may be hindering proper interaction.  The call logs provide valuable insights into the specific issues and should aid in debugging.
