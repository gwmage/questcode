# QA Report for eposo.ai Website Testing

## Summary

**Test Failed.** The agent successfully logged in and navigated to the Timeline and Settings pages. However, it encountered issues interacting with dynamic elements on the Timeline page (adding milestones and stories) and failed to add a user to a project in the Settings page due to persistent element interaction errors. These failures indicate potential issues with the website's front-end event handling and element stability.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in to eposo.ai
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 2: Navigate to the Timeline
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 3: Verify and Input Data in Timeline's Milestone Function
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was unable to interact with the Milestone creation and editing functionalities on the Timeline page. Attempts to click the "수정 파일 업로드로 AI 일정 생성하기" button (to add a milestone) and to fill the milestone content field timed out or resulted in element interaction errors. This may indicate that the elements are dynamically loaded and the agent is attempting to interact with them before they are fully initialized, or that there are other underlying issues preventing the click from registering.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the '수정 파일 업로드로 AI 일정 생성하기' button (to add a milestone).
  2. Click '새로운 마일스톤 내용' to open the milestone edit modal.
  3. Fill the milestone title input field with '테스트 마일스톤'.
  4. Attempt to fill the milestone content input field with '마일스톤 내용 테스트입니다.'.
- **Final Error Log:**
  ```
  page.fill: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
  Call log:
  2m   waiting for locator(dataaiid399)22m
  ```
  This error indicates a timeout while waiting for the milestone content input field (locator `dataaiid399`) to become available for filling.

### Objective 4: Verify and Input Data in Timeline's Story Function
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** After repeated failures to interact with the Milestone feature, the agent attempted to interact with the Story functionality but encountered similar issues. It was unable to click a story from the list to edit it, suggesting a consistent problem with event handling or element accessibility on the Timeline page.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the '스토리 추가' button.
  2. Click '스토리 #5' from the story list.
- **Final Error Log:** No specific error log provided, however the lack of progress strongly suggests an interaction problem.

### Objective 5: Add a User to the "소개팅앱X" Project in Settings
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was unable to successfully add a user to the "소개팅앱X" project. There were repeated failures to fill the email input field and/or successfully trigger the add user action. This is likely due to a combination of incorrect locators and the dynamic nature of the elements involved in the user addition process. The role dropdown did seem to work fine.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the '환경' menu to navigate to the settings page.
  2. Click '소개팅앱X' project.
  3. Fill the email input field with 'gwmage@rcanelab.com' (attempt 1 - incorrect locator).
  4. Fill the email input field with 'gwmage@rcanelab.com' (attempt 2 - corrected locator).
  5. Click the '추가' button next to the email input.
  6. Click the '관리자' dropdown to show role options
  7. Click the '고객' to select customer role.
  8. Fill the email input field with 'gwmage@rcanelab.com'.
  9. Click the '추가' button next to the email input again.
- **Final Error Log:**
  ```
  page.fill: Error: Element is not an input, textarea, select or contenteditable and does not have a role allowing ariareadonly
  Call log:
  2m   waiting for locator(dataaiid174)22m
  2m     locator resolved to span dataaiid174 datave47eb32e classsettingpage__infotit breakkeep span22m
  2m     fill(gwmagercanelab.com)22m
  ```
  This error indicates that the identified element ([data-ai-id="174"]) is not an input field that allows direct text entry. This highlights a critical issue with the element locators and/or element type identification.

### Objective 6: Log out and Finish
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped due to the persistent failures encountered in previous steps.
