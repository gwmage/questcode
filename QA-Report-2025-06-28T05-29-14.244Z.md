# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent was unable to log in to the eposo.ai website using the provided email and password.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** Despite multiple attempts to input the correct email and password and submit the form, the login process did not complete. The 'Email Login' button appeared unresponsive even with forced clicks and keypress actions. This suggests a potential issue with the login form submission or backend authentication.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the 'Login/Sign Up' button.
  2. Click the 'Email Login' button.
  3. Fill the email field with gwmage@naver.com
  4. Fill the password field with dmdrk1818!
  5. Click the 'Email Login' button to submit the form.
  6. Press 'Enter' key in the password field
  7. Click the 'Email Login' button with force: true
- **Final Error Log:** No specific error log was provided in the action history, but the repeated attempts to submit the form without any change in the page state indicate a failure in the login process. The agent did not receive a success or error message, suggesting a possible silent failure in the form submission or authentication.

### Objective 2: Create a new project
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped because the initial login step failed. The agent could not access the project creation functionality without successfully logging in.

### Objective 3: Log out
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped because the initial login step failed. The agent could not access the logout functionality without successfully logging in.
