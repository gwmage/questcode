# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent failed to log in due to unresponsive UI elements.  Subsequent steps were skipped as a result of this initial failure. This is a critical blocker.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in to eposo.ai
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent encountered unresponsive UI elements on the login page, preventing successful login.  The agent was unable to enter the email address or password, and subsequent clicks on the login button also failed.  The agent seems to have become stuck, potentially due to a problem with the website's JavaScript or the interaction between the agent and the website's DOM.
- **Attempted Actions:**
    1. Click the Login/Sign Up button
    2. Click the Email Login button
    3. Enter email address
    4. Enter the password
    5. Click the Email Login button to log in
    6. [Forced Action] Click 'Find Account' (Agent attempted to break out of a perceived loop)
    7. Navigate back to the login page
    8. Navigate to the login page
    9. Navigate to the login page
- **Final Error Log:**
```
Step 3: Enter email address
  - Error: Action 'Enter email address' resulted in no change to the page's interactive elements. The agent might be stuck.
Step 4: Enter the password
  - Error: Action 'Enter the password' resulted in no change to the page's interactive elements. The agent might be stuck.
Step 5: Click the Email Login button to log in
  - Error: Action 'Click the Email Login button to log in' resulted in no change to the page's interactive elements. The agent might be stuck.
Step 7: Navigate back to the login page
  - Error: Action 'Navigate back to the login page' resulted in no change to the page's interactive elements. The agent might be stuck.
Step 8: Navigate to the login page
  - Error: Action 'Navigate to the login page' resulted in no change to the page's interactive elements. The agent might be stuck.
Step 9: Navigate to the login page
  - Error: Action 'Navigate to the login page' resulted in no change to the page's interactive elements. The agent might be stuck.
```
The repeated error message "resulted in no change to the page's interactive elements" suggests a serious problem with the website's functionality or the agent's ability to interact with it.  Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause.
