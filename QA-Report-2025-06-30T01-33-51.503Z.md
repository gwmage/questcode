# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent successfully logged in and navigated to the timeline, but was unable to add content to either milestones or stories due to unresponsive UI elements and a persistent bottom alert that obscured key navigation elements. The test was therefore terminated prematurely.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 2: 이동합니다.
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 3: 타임라인에서 마일스톤과 스토리 기능이 정상 동작하는지 확인합니다.
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was able to navigate to the timeline page. The attempt to interact with milestone item '테스트 마일스톤' by opening dropdown menu was success. But unable to input contents. Because there aren't any input elements in milestone modal. Also, after that, The agent attempted to add a story by clicking the '스토리 추가' button, but the expected modal did not appear, and multiple clicks yielded no response. This indicates a potential issue with the rendering of the story modal or event handling of the button.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click '테스트 마일스톤's dropdown_gray
  2. Click "edit" Button in Milestone modal
  3. Input milestone title at input element
  4. click "저장" Button in Milestone modal
  5. click '스토리 추가' Button in timeline
  6. click '스토리 추가' Button in timeline
- **Final Error Log:** No specific error log was generated, as the button clicks were registered but did not trigger the intended modal to appear. The absence of an error log makes debugging more challenging, suggesting that the event handler might not be correctly attached or the modal rendering logic is failing silently.

### Objective 4: 스토리에서 담당자를 지정해봅니다.
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped due to the failure in Objective 3, which prevented the addition of stories to the timeline.

### Objective 5: 설정에서 "소개팅앱X" 프로젝트에 gwmage@rcanelab.com 사용자를 "고객"으로 추가합니다.
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** The persistent bottom alert block '프로젝트 시트가 부족합니다' obstructs the '환경' link, so can't proceed to settings page.

### Objective 6: 로그아웃하고 테스트를 마칩니다.
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped because unable to move to next stage
