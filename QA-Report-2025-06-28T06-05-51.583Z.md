# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Partially Passed.** The agent successfully logged in, navigated to the settings and added an admin user, and logged out. However, there were issues interacting with the timeline, specifically inputting text into milestone and timeline fields, which caused the test to be only partially passed.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 2: Navigate to the Timeline
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 3: Timeline - Check Milestone and Story Functionality and Input Data
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent timed out while trying to input text into the milestone and timeline input fields. The error logs show the element was not editable, suggesting that it might be readonly or disabled. It could also mean some other element is obscuring the input fields, preventing the bot from interacting with them.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Input text into the first milestone input field
  2. Input text into the second timeline input field
- **Final Error Log:**
\`\`\`
page.fill: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
Call log:
2m   waiting for locator(input[type="text"])
2m     locator resolved to 10 elements. Proceeding with the first one: input readonly type="text" tabindex="0" placeholder teleport="false" autoposition="false" class="custom-datepicker"

\`\`\`
The log indicates that the input element was found but deemed "not editable." This suggests a potential issue with the element's properties or its accessibility within the DOM.

\`\`\`
page.fill: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
Call log:
2m   waiting for locator(input[type="text"]:nth-child(2))
\`\`\`
This timeout suggests that the second input field was not found or not accessible within the specified timeframe.

### Objective 4: Story - Assign a Person
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped due to failure to reliably interact with timeline elements.

### Objective 5: Settings - Add User as Admin
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 6: Log out
- **Status:** Success
