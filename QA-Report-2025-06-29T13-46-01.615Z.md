# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent encountered UI interaction issues preventing completion of all test objectives after the initial login attempt.  The agent appears to have become stuck, failing to interact with the website as expected.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in to eposo.ai
- **Status:** Success
- **Reason:**  Despite errors in entering the email and password (no change to UI observed), the agent proceeded and seemingly logged in successfully. This requires further investigation as the input actions may not be functioning correctly.

### Objective 2: Navigate to Timeline
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent failed to navigate to the timeline. The action to crawl the page for timeline-related interactive elements did not result in any UI changes, suggesting the agent is unable to interact with the page correctly.
- **Attempted Actions:**
    1. Crawling the page to find interactive elements related to the timeline.
- **Final Error Log:**
    ```
    Error: Action 'Crawling the page to find interactive elements related to the timeline.' resulted in no change to the page's interactive elements. The agent might be stuck.
    ```
    This error indicates a problem with the agent's interaction with the webpage. It's unclear whether the page failed to load correctly, the agent's crawling mechanism is faulty, or if there's another underlying issue preventing interaction.

### Objective 3: Verify Milestone and Story Functionality on Timeline
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:**  Skipped due to failure to navigate to the Timeline.

### Objective 4: Input Data into Milestone and Timeline
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:**  Skipped due to failure to navigate to the Timeline.

### Objective 5: Assign User to a Story
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:**  Skipped due to failure to navigate to the Timeline.


### Objective 6: Add User as Administrator in Settings
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:**  Skipped due to failure to navigate to the Timeline, preventing access to Settings.

### Objective 7: Log out
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:**  Skipped due to prior failures.  Logging out is not relevant if the core test objectives could not be completed.


## Potential Root Causes and Next Steps

1. **JavaScript Errors:** The website's JavaScript might be encountering errors, preventing the UI elements from functioning correctly.  Checking browser developer console logs during agent execution is crucial.
2. **Agent Framework Issues:** The autonomous agent's framework might have bugs affecting its ability to interact with specific web elements or handle dynamic content.
3. **Network Connectivity:** Transient network problems during the test might have interfered with page loading or interaction.  Verify network stability and retry the test.
4. **Timing Issues:** The agent might be acting too quickly before the page fully loads. Implementing explicit waits or checks for UI element availability could resolve this.
5. **Incorrect Locators:** The agent might be using incorrect selectors or locators to identify interactive elements.  Review and validate the locators used by the agent.


It is highly recommended to investigate the JavaScript console logs in the browser during the agent's execution for any errors.  This will likely provide the most valuable information for debugging the observed issues.  Additionally, reviewing network requests and responses could shed light on potential network-related problems.
