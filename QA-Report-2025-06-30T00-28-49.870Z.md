# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent was unable to log in to eposo.ai due to an issue where the "Login/Sign Up" button on the landing page did not navigate to the login page. The test environment also reported that JavaScript was not enabled, potentially contributing to the failure.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was unable to navigate to the login page after clicking the "Login/Sign Up" button on the landing page. The page context remained the same, indicating the button's navigation was not functioning as expected. The error message "We're sorry but EPOSO doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled." suggests a potential issue with JavaScript execution in the testing environment, which could have prevented the button from functioning correctly.
