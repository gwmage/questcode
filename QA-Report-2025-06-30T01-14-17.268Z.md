### Objective 3: Interact with Milestone Feature
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was unable to input content into the milestone modal. After several attempts and timeouts related to the milestone content input field, it indicates a potential problem with the stability or accessibility of the element, or a general issue with the modal itself.
