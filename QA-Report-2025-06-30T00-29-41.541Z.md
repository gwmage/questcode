# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent was unable to proceed beyond the landing page due to a JavaScript error, preventing login and subsequent functional testing.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was unable to navigate to the login page. The initial click on the "Login/Sign Up" button did not result in a page change. This is due to the website displaying the message "We're sorry but EPOSO doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled." indicating a fundamental problem preventing any interactive elements from functioning.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the 'Login/Sign Up' button.
- **Final Error Log:** The page remained unchanged, with the same elements visible after the click action. The following message was displayed on the page: "We're sorry but EPOSO doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled. Please enable it to continue." This message is a critical indicator of the failure cause, as the application requires JavaScript to function. This prevents the Login/Sign Up button from working as intended.
