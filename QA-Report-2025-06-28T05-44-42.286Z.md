# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Partially Passed.** The agent successfully logged in and logged out, but failed to create a new project.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 2: Create a new project named 'Automated QA Project'
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was able to navigate to the project settings page, but encountered issues when attempting to create a new project. The '추가프로젝트 추가' button seemed to trigger a page reload without actually creating a project. Furthermore, filling the project name field resulted in timeout errors, indicating the input element was either not enabled or not editable. There also seems to be a character limit of 7 on the project name.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the button to create a new project ('무료로 프로젝트 만들러 가기').
  2. Click the button to add a new project ('추가프로젝트 추가').
  3. Fill the project name field with 'Automated QA Project'.
  4. Click the button to add a new project ('추가프로젝트 추가').
  5. Fill the project name field with 'Auto QA'.
  6. Click the button to add a new project ('추가프로젝트 추가').
  7. Click the Dashboard link ('대시보드').
  8. Click the Setting link to go back to the settings page ('환경').
  9. Fill the project name field with 'QAAuto'.
  10. Click the button to add a new project ('추가프로젝트 추가').
  11. Click the Dashboard link to check if the project was created ('대시보드').
- **Final Error Log:**

```
This error indicates that the input field was not enabled, preventing the agent from filling the project name. The `readonly class disabled` attribute on the input field suggests the field was intentionally disabled, or there is a problem in the UI rendering.

### Objective 3: Log out
- **Status:** Success
