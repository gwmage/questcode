  \`\`\`
  This error log shows a timeout while attempting to click a button during the onboarding process. The "div type=button class=cpopup\_\_dimdiv from div datavappdiv subtree intercepts pointer events" message suggests that another element (a dimming overlay) is intercepting the click, preventing the intended button from being activated. This could be due to layering issues or the dimming overlay not being properly dismissed.

### Objective 3: Log out
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped because the critical 'Create a new project' step failed and the agent was unable to navigate away from the onboarding screen to access the logout option.
