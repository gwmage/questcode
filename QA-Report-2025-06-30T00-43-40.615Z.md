# QA Report for eposo.ai

## Summary
**Test Partially Passed.** The agent successfully logged in, navigated to the timeline, and interacted with the milestone and story features. However, adding a user to a project in settings failed, and the test was terminated before logging out.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in to Eposo.ai
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 2: Navigate to Timeline
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 3: Verify Milestone and Story Functionality on Timeline
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 4: Input Content into Milestone and Story
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 5: Assign a User to a Story
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 6: Add gwmage@rcanelab.com as "고객" to "소개팅앱X" Project
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** The agent was unable to find the input field to enter the email address. It's possible the element was not loaded, was hidden, or the locator was incorrect.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Type "gwmage@rcanelab.com" into "//body/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div/div/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/input".
- **Final Error Log:**
  ```
  TimeoutError: locator.type: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
  =========================== logs ===========================

      at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)
  ```
  This error indicates that the agent waited 30 seconds for the specified input field to become available but it never did, resulting in a timeout. This could be due to slow loading times or the input field not existing in the DOM.

### Objective 7: Log out
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** The test was terminated before logging out due to the failure in Objective 6.
