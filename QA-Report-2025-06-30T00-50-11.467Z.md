# QA Report for eposo.ai Functionality Check

## Summary
**Test Failed.** The agent successfully logged in and navigated to the Timeline, but encountered issues when attempting to interact with the Milestone and Story functions. The UI did not behave as expected, indicating potential problems with event handling or modal loading.

## Details

### Objective 1: Log in
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 2: Navigate to Timeline
- **Status:** Success

### Objective 3: Verify and Interact with Milestone and Story Functions
- **Status:** Failure
- **Reason:** After successfully logging in and navigating to the timeline, the agent attempted to add a new milestone and a new story, expecting a modal to appear for data input. However, clicking the respective "추가" buttons did not trigger any UI changes. This indicates a problem with the event handlers attached to these buttons, preventing the modal from loading and the features from being tested.
- **Attempted Actions:**
  1. Click the '마일스톤 추가' button.
  2. Click the '스토리 추가' button.
- **Final Error Log:** No specific error logs were generated, but the UI remained unchanged after attempting to add a milestone or story, suggesting that the button click did not trigger the expected modal to open. This is likely a front-end issue.

- **Status:** Skipped
- **Reason:** Skipped because the primary 'Verify and Interact with Milestone and Story Functions' step failed.
